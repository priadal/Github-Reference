<p>This should bring you to to a page titled "Create a new repository". In the text box underneath "Repository name", type what you would like your page to be called. Make sure to add ".io" after the name to make it a web page. Once this is done, check the "Public" circle in order to make sure your page is public. After this chech the box next to the text that reads "Initialize this repository with a README", this will ensure your page will be made. Finally once all this is done, you may click the green "Create repository" button on the bottom of the page. </p>
<h2>Step 4:</h2>

<p>From here you may upload the files you would like to show on your web page by clicking the "Upload files" button. However, your website is almost done, so from this page click on the little "Settings" tab that features a gear icon towards the top of your screen.</p>
<h2>Step 5:</h2>
<img src="assets/step5.png" alt="step5">
<p>Now that you should be on your settings page, scroll down the page until you see the "Github Pages" section. Under "Source" there will be a dropdown menu labeled "none", click on the dropdown menu and click on "master branch". Your page should automatically refresh (if not, refresh it yourself).</p>
<h2>Step 6:</h2>
<img src="assets/step6.png" alt="step6">
<p>Now that you're back on your settings page again, scroll down to the "Github Pages" section again. However, now there should be a blue banner saying "Your site is ready to be published at [your domain name]". This just means your site is loading and needs a second to figure it out. Refresh the page again. If it's stil blue, wait a couple minutes and refresh again until the banner turns green.</p>
<h2>Step 7:</h2>
<img src="assets/step7.png" alt="step7">
<p>Now that your banner is green, it should say "Your site is published at [your domain name]". Click on the blue highlighed domain link.</p>
<h2>Step 8:</h2>
<img src="assets/step8.png" alt="step8">
<p>Your page should now be showing your webpage with its title, and any uploaded files (if you uploaded anything).</p>
